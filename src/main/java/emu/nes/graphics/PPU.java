         * The value of OAMADDR at this tick determines the starting address for sprite evaluation for this scanline,

         * If OAMADDR is unaligned and does not point to the Y position (first byte) of an OAM entry,
         * then whatever it points to (tile index, attribute, or X coordinate) will be reinterpreted as a Y position.
