        /*
         * Sprite 0 hit does not happen:

If background or sprite rendering is disabled in PPUMASK ($2001)
At x=0 to x=7 if the left-side clipping window is enabled (if bit 2 or bit 1 of PPUMASK is 0).
At x=255, for an obscure reason related to the pixel pipeline.
At any pixel where the background or sprite pixel is transparent
(2-bit color index from the CHR pattern is %00).
If sprite 0 hit has already occurred this frame. Bit 6 of PPUSTATUS ($2002)
is cleared to 0 at dot 1 of the pre-render line.
This means only the first sprite 0 hit in a frame can be detected.
Sprite 0 hit happens regardless of the following:

Sprite priority. Sprite 0 can still hit the background from behind.
The pixel colors. Only the CHR pattern bits are relevant, not the actual rendered colors,
and any CHR color index except %00 is considered opaque.
The palette. The contents of the palette are irrelevant to sprite 0 hits.
For example: a black ($0F) sprite pixel can hit a black ($0F) background
as long as neither is the transparent color index %00.
The PAL PPU blanking on the left and right edges at x=0, x=1, and x=254 (see Overscan).
